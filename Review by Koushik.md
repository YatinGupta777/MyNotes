## Review Points
1. Better code practices/standards
2. Better organizational skills

### Learnings

1. Folder
2. Schema -- all fields necessary -- go through all fields
3. Schema should be adaptable
4. From/to fields can refer to user model
5. If user changes name
6. Craetea. different model for message
7. Define schema properly always
8. Think about backward compataibility
9. Differentiaiting the schema properly
10. Everything should be scalable especially in database perspective
11. Name fields appropriately
12. Segragrate apis based on models
13. Route-->Model->Schema
14. Models/Routes/Schema
15. Modesl have function
15. Route just call the model and send response
16. Make models function reuasble in different routes
17. Request in route send to model fucntion and return as response
18. Add check statements as obj in top and use just the name
19. Validations in utils folder make it reusable
20. Segregrate the error codes : http response codes link
21. Never encode static text
22. Use eslint
23. Remove consoles
24. No try catch for entire block
25. Network call or handling promise -- try catch
26. Constansts in a single file
27. Map or foreach instead of for
28. Construct error formayt in different middleware -- to ensure error have same stucture
29. Also for success middleare
30. Code should itself explain , give meaningful names
31. No need of nested folder. Routes is itself explanatory
32. Can deifne base route then add aditonal routes in another variable 
33. Dont have code commented in repo
34. .env define env variables. ADD IN GITIGNORE
35. Socket connections in separate util
36. SLAP -- reduce your function


Thank you so much Koushik. It was really informative. We will keep in mind all the learnings and incorporate all the changes in our code as well !
